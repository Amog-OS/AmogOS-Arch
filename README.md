# AmogOS-Arch
Arch Linux edition of AmogOS

# Discord servers
https://discord.gg/ZEgVgEzSxz <- Arch version support  
https://discord.gg/WcPRRezhZV <- Main Debian version support

# Differences
This version is based on Archlinux, so you can use all of the latest packages like  python 3.10.

it includes yay aur helper by default

it actually installs on baremetal since it's based on a ACLI (arch Linux calamares installer) and the default DE is XFCE4.

uses XFCE4 (preconfigured.)

has tools to easily install window managers and desktop environments if you hate XFCE.
# why is there no source code yet?
i will add the source code when its stable enough for release, i will also have instructions on how to build too if you dont want to use XFCE oob.
